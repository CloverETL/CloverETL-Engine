/**
 * Registry for instances of Hadoop FileSystem class used to work-around FileSystem.CACHE issues (CLO-1160, CLO-730, ...).
 * 
 * Hadoop FileSystem instances retrieved by {@link FileSystem#get(URI, Configuration, String)} (or similar "get" methods)
 * are cached in internal FileSystem.CACHE so anyone asking for a FileSystem may receive an instance which they share with someone else.
 * Therefore, it is dangerous to close such a shared instance if someone else is still going to need it (this is definitively the case
 * with the DistributeFileSystem class instances -- CLO-1160).
 * 
 * So how this workaround works:
 * FileSystem owner (any entity that is going to use a FileSystem; may be e.g. a component, connection, whatever Object) 
 * indicates that it is going to use a FileSystem instance by registering the instance with this registry 
 * ({@link #getAndRegister(URI, Configuration, String, Object)}, or just {@link #registerFileSystem(FileSystem, Object)} methods).
 * Once the owner doesn't need the FileSystem anymore, it must release the FileSytem with the {@link #release(FileSystem, Object)}
 * method. This registry keeps track of all owners of all FileSystems and once there are
 * no more users of particular FileSytsem, it closes the FileSystem.
