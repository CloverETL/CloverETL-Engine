/**
 * The following comments are from the http://ldbc.sourceforge.net project.
 * These are the issues with HSQLDB JDBC implementation that are currently
 * not resolved. Other issues stated there have been resolved in 1.7.2.
 *
 * ResultSet.getString() on a DECIMAL data type should return the value
 * formatted for example for DECIMAL(10,2) the returned value should be 0.00
 * and not 0
 *
 * ResultSetMetaData precision and scale are not returned - always 0.
 *
 * Time format error: the following statement should work, but throws an exception:
 * CREATE TABLE Test ( ID INT , Current DATETIME )
 * insert into test values(1,'2002-01-01 0:0:0.0')
 * This works:
 * insert into test values(1,'2002-01-01 00:00:00.0')
 *
 * ABS(4) returns data type DECIMAL, should return data type INTEGER
 *
 * Should throw a exception if PreparedStatement.setObject(1,null) is called.
 * See also JDBC API Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition,
 * page 544, 24.1.5 Sending JDBC NULL as an IN parameter
 *
 * Statement / PreparedStatement setMaxFieldSize is ignored.
 *
 * The database should support at least Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED.
 * Currently, only TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED is supported.
 *
 * Statement.getQueryTimeout doesn't return the value set before.
 *
 * When autocommit is on, executing a query on a statement is
 * supposed to close the old resultset. This is not implemented.

 *  When using the JDBC 2 methods that require those values as parameters or
