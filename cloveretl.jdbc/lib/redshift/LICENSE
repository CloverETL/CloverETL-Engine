This License Agreement (this “License Agreement”) is effective as of September 13, 2016, by and between Amazon
Corporate LLC (“AWS” or “we”) and Javlin, a.s. (“you”). Unless otherwise defined in this License Agreement, capitalized
terms will have the same meaning as set forth in the AWS Customer Agreement posted at aws.amazon.com/agreement
(the “AWS Agreement”).

1. Use of the Software; Distribution

We hereby grant you a personal, limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to install and use the
Amazon Redshift ODBC Driver Software and JDBC Driver Software, including any updates and enhancements to it and
accompanying documentation delivered by us to you (the “Software”), for the sole purpose of accessing Amazon Redshift
(or any successor service designated by us in writing). You may distribute the Software, provided that (a) you distribute the
Software as part of a program that you develop; (b) you add significant functionality to it in your program; (c) you require
end users to agree to terms that are consistent with, and at least as protective of AWS and the Software as, this License
Agreement; (d) you retain without modification any copyright, patent, trademark, or attribution notices that are present in
the Software; and (e) you distribute the Software for the sole purpose of accessing Amazon Redshift (or any successor
service designated by us in writing). All rights granted to you are conditioned on your continued compliance this License
Agreement and your maintenance of an account in good standing with AWS. Some components of the Software (whether
developed by AWS or third parties) may be governed by applicable open source software licenses. Your license rights with
respect to these individual components are defined by the applicable open source software licenses, and nothing in this
License Agreement will restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations you may have, or conditions to which you
may be subject, under such open source software licenses.

2. Limitations

Except as expressly permitted under this License Agreement, you may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize
any other person to, (a) sell, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute, act as a service bureau, publicly communicate, transform, or
sub-license the Software or otherwise assign any rights to the Software in whole or in part; (b) modify, alter, tamper with,
repair, or otherwise create derivative works of the Software, (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Software
or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Software, or (d) access or
use the Software in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas.

3. Reservation of Rights

You may not use the Software for any illegal purpose. The Software is the intellectual property of AWS or its licensors. The
structure, organization, and code of the Software are valuable trade secrets and confidential information of AWS or its
licensors. The Software is protected by law, including without limitation copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Except for the rights explicitly granted to you in this License Agreement, all right, title and interest in the Software are
reserved and retained by us and our licensors. You do not acquire any intellectual property or other rights in the Software
as a result of downloading the Software.

4. Updates

In order to keep the Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or manual updates at any time. If we elect to provide
maintenance or support of any kind, we may terminate that maintenance or support at any time without notice to you.

5. Termination

You may terminate this License Agreement at any time by uninstalling or destroying all copies of the Software that are in
your possession or control. Without liability to you, AWS may terminate this License Agreement upon 180 days’ notice;
except that AWS may terminate this License Agreement immediately if AWS believes (a) it is necessary to address an
emergency or threat to the security or integrity of AWS, (b) it is necessary to respond to claims, litigation, or loss of license
rights related to third-party intellectual property rights, (c) it is necessary to comply with the law or requests of a
government entity, or (d) the Software becomes, or is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of any
intellectual property right. In the case of termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the Software, and you must
destroy all copies of the Software. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this License Agreement
will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights. Your rights under this License Agreement will automatically terminate
without notice from us if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 will
survive termination on this License Agreement.
