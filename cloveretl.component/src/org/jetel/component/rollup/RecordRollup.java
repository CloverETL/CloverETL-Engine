/**
 * <p>Represents an interface of a rollup transform which processes groups of data records. Each group of data records
 * may share a data record referred to as a group "accumulator". It may be used to store intermediate results. The group
 * "accumulator" is created an initialized when the first data record of a group is encountered and updated for each
 * data record in this group (including the first and the last data record). When the last data record of a group is
 * encountered, processing of this group is finished and the group "accumulator" is disposed. If the input data records
 * are not sorted, each group is finished as soon as all input data records are read and processed.</p>
 * <p>The life cycle of a rollup transform is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link #init(Properties, DataRecordMetadata, DataRecordMetadata, DataRecordMetadata[])} method is called
 *   to initialize the transform.</li>
 *   <li>For each input data record as a current data record:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>If the current data record belongs to a new group:
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>If requested, a group "accumulator" is created.</li>
 *           <li>The {@link #initGroup(DataRecord, DataRecord)} method is called to initialize processing of the group
 *           and to initialize the "accumulator" (if it exists).</li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>The {@link #updateGroup(DataRecord, DataRecord)} method is called for the current data record and
 *       the corresponding group "accumulator" (if it was requested).</li>
 *       <li>If the method returned <code>true</code>, the {@link #updateTransform(int, DataRecord, DataRecord, DataRecord[])}
 *       method is called repeatedly to generate output data record(s) until it returns RecordRollup.SKIP. If it returns
 *       value < RecordRollup.SKIP, the {@link #getMessage()} method is called.</li>
 *       <li>If the current data record is the last one in its group:
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>The {@link #finishGroup(DataRecord, DataRecord)} method is called to finish the group processing.</li>
 *           <li>If the method returned <code>true</code>, the {@link #transform(int, DataRecord, DataRecord, DataRecord[])}
 *           method is called repeatedly to generate output data record(s) until it returns RecordRollup.SKIP. If it
 *           returns value < RecordRollup.SKIP, the {@link #getMessage()} method is called.</li>
 *           <li>If the group "accumulator" was requested, its contents is disposed.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>The {@link #finished()} method is called to notify that the rollup transform finished.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link #reset()} method may optionally be called to reset the transformation and so that the previous
 *   two steps may be executed again.</li>
 * </ul>
