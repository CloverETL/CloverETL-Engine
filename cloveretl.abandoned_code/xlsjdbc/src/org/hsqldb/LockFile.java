/**
 * The base HSQLDB cooperative file locking implementation and factory. <p>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Here is the way this class operates: <p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>A file with a well-known path relative to each database instance
 *     is used to implement cooperative locking of database files across
 *     process boundaries (database instances running in different JVM
 *     host processes) and class loader contexts (databases whose classes
 *     have been loaded by distinct class loaders such that their open
 *     database repositories are distinct and are inaccessible across
 *     the class loader context boundaries).<p>
 *
 * <li>A background thread periodically writes a timestamp to this object's
 *     lock file at {@link #HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL} millisecond intervals,
 *     acting as a heartbeat to indicate that a lock is still held.<p>
 *
 * <li>The generic lock attempt rules are: <p>
 *    <ul>
 *    <li>If a lock condition is already held by this object, do nothing and
 *        signify that the lock attempt was successful, else...<p>
 *
 *    <li>If no lock file exists, go ahead and create one, silently issue the
 *        {@link java.io.File#deleteOnExit File.deleteOnExit()} directive via
 *        refelective method invocation (in order to stay JDK 1.1 compliant),
 *        schedule a periodic heartbeat task and signify that the lock attempt
 *        was successful, else...<p>
 *
 *    <li>The lock file must already exist, so try to read its heartbeat
 *        timestamp. If the read fails, assume that a lock condition is held by
 *        another process or a database in an inaccessible class loader context
 *        and signify that the attempt failed, else if the read value
 *        is less than <code>HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL</code> milliseconds into the
 *        past or futuer, assume that a lock condition is held by another
 *        process or a database in an inaccessible class loader context and
 *        signify that the lock attempt failed, else assume that the file is
 *        not in use, schedule a periodic heartbeat task and signify that the
 *        lock attempt was successful.<p>
 *
 *    </ul>
 * <li>The generic release attempt rules are:<p>
 *    <ul>
 *    <li>If a lock condition is not currently held, do nothing and signify
 *        that the release attempt was successful, else...<p>
 *
 *    <li>A lock condition is currently held, so try to release it.  By
 *        default, releasing the lock condition consists of closing and
 *        nullifying any objects that have a file descriptor open on the
 *        lock file. If the release is successful, cancel the periodic
 *        heartbeat task and signify that the release succeeded, else signify
 *        that the release attempt failed.<p>
 *    </ul>
 * </ol> <p>
 *
 * In addition to the generic lock and release rules, the protected methods
 * {@link #lockImpl() lockImpl()} and {@link #releaseImpl() releaseImpl()}
 * are called during lock and release attempts, respectively.  This allows
 * transparent, JDK 1.1 compliant integration of extended strategies for
 * locking and releasing, based on subclassing and reflective construction
 * of such specializations in the factory method
 * {@link #newLockFile newLockFile()}, determined by information gathered
 * at run-time. <p>
 *
 * In particular, if it is available at runtime, then newLockFile() retrieves
 * instances of {@link org.hsqldb.NIOLockFile  NIOLockFile} to capitalize,
 * when possible, on the existence of the {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock
 * FileLock} class. If the <code>NIOLockFile</code> class does not exist at
 * run-time or the java.nio classes it uses are not supported under the
 * run-time JVM, then newLockFile() produces vanilla LockFile instances,
 * meaning that only purely cooperative locking takes place, as opposed to
 * possibly O/S-enforced file locking which, at least in theory, is made
 * available through the {@link java.nio.channels} package). However, it
 * must be noted that even if a JVM implementation provides the full
 * java.nio.channels package, it is not absolutely required to guarantee
 * that the underlying platform (the current operating system) provides
 * true process-wide file locking. <p>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> <p>
 *
 * The <code>NIOLockFile</code> descendent exists because it has been determined
 * though experimenatation that <code>java.nio.channels.FileLock</code>
 * does not always exhibit the correct/desired behaviour under reflective
 * method invocation. That is, it has been discovered that under some operating
 * system/JVM combinations, after calling <code>FileLock.release()</code>
 * via a reflective method invocation, the lock is not released properly,
 * deletion of the lock file is not possible even from the owning object
 * (this) and it is impossible for other <code>LockFile</code> instances
 * or any other objects or processes to successfully obtain a lock
 * condition on the lock file, despite the fact that the <code>FileLock</code>
 * object reports that its lock is invalid (was released successfully).
 * Frustratingly, this condition appears to persist until full exit of the
 * JVM process in which the <code>FileLock.tryLock()</code> method was
 * reflectively invoked. <p>
 *
 * To solve this, the original <code>LockFile</code> class was split in two and
 * instead of reflective method invocation, reflection-based class
 * instantiation is now performed at the level of the <code>newLockFile()</code>
 * factory method. Similarly, the HSQLDB ANT build script detects the presence
 * or abscence of JDK 1.4 features such as java.nio and only attempts to build
 * and deploy <code>NIOLockFile</code> to the hsqldb.jar if such features are
 * reported present. </p>
