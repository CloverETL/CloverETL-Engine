#MAX_RECORD_SIZE - this limits the maximum size of data record in binary form. The binary form is the form used by Clover 
#when manipulating data.
#Parser are here to convert text representation or database representation of data records to Clover's internal. 
#Some data can have larger representation in text form - dates, numbers and some shorter - strings, for example 
#(java stores strings in unicode - 16bits per character).
#If you start getting buffer overflow or similar errors, increase this value. The limit is theoretically 2^31 , 
#but you should keep it under 64K.
#Clover at runtime allocates several internal buffers of MAX_RECORD_SIZE, thus increasing this value increases also 
#memory utilization. 

Record.MAX_RECORD_SIZE = 131072

#FIELD_BUFFER_LENGTH - this is constant for textual data parsers. 
#It determines what is the maximum size of one particular data field in text format. 
#If you have data containing long text strings, increase this value. Could be 1024,2048 or even higher.
#The impact on memory utilization is low as each parser your graph uses allocates only one such buffer. 

DataParser.FIELD_BUFFER_LENGTH = 16384


#the same as above, but for formatting data to text representation
#should be set to the same value as above

DataFormatter.FIELD_BUFFER_LENGTH = 16384


#This constant determines the internal buffer clover components allocate for I/O operations. 
#Again, increasing this value does not have big impact on overall memory utilization as only 
#few such buffers are used at runtime. There is no sence in increasing this value to speed up something. 
#It has been tested that the performance improvement is negligible. 
#However, if you increase the size of MAX_RECORD_SIZE , make sure this value is minimally 2*MAX_RECORD_SIZE.
