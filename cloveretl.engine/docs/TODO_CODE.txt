TODO list:
* change handling of null values with individual fields - use bit-array at record level to indicate which 
  field has null value

* implement external sorting
* implement merge component - merging of data flows based on keys specified
* implement data joiner - joining of data flows based on keys 
* implement external look-up tables - sort of hash-files used for hash-joins and lookup tables in general
