                          CLOVER ETL - HISTORY of RELEASES
*******************************************************************************

REL 1-1-0
---------
New features:
+ change of lincese from GPL to LGPL
+ enhanced DBOutputTable to allow for hand-written SQL/DML statements - this
should give 100% flexibility when populating target DB table
+ improved CopySQL primitives to cope with basic datatype conversions - integer->decimal,
date->datetime, etc. - it regards to Clover-DB interaction
+ graph layouts (component attributes) can now reference globally defined
properties (through ${...property name...} ). These references are resolved
when materializing componets/metadata.
+ added handling of NULLs when copying data to/from Database 
for fields (String, Date, Integer, Numeric);
+ for components requiring transformation classes to be specified (e.g. Reformat,Joins..),
the possibility to embed the Java source into XML text defining graph layout is possible. The source
code gets automatically compiled. When the graph is executed multiple times, it is
checked whether the source code changed and if not, compilation is skipped.

Bugs corrected:
+ fixed bug in CopyDate class (CopySQLData) when copying/setting DATE filed - thanks to Khelfa Mohamed
