                          CLOVER ETL - HISTORY of RELEASES
*******************************************************************************

REL 1-1-2
---------
New features:
+ extended ExtFilter - org.jetel.interpreter has been
extended, it now supports arithmetic operations and
has several built-in functions.

Changes:
+ added several new "macros" to org.jetel.data.GetVal

REL 1-1-1
---------
New features:
+ added DBF data/database reader. It comes with DBFAnalyze utility
which reads in DBF table and produces Clover metadata describing the
record structure. See examples (graphDBFRead) for illustration how it works.
+ created ExtFilter component which somehow resembles "old" Filter
with several enhancements (supports logical operators AND,OR,NOT,
braces, etc.)
+ created org.jetel.interpreter package - currently, code
supporting ExtFilter is there. This should become base
for Clover's internal transformation language interpreter.
+ for all data fields types, own hashCode() method implemented.

Changes:
+ All components which work on stream of records now contain yield() call (wihin
their main processing loop. This should improve thread scheduling and consequently
help improve data flow throughout the graph.
+ introduced checking of name validity for Nodes (all components), Edges,
Records, Fields. Allowed characters are [A-Za-z0-9_]. This is due to
planned future enhancements. Up to this version, was no particular constraint.
+ rearranged/refactored packages & classes. All data parsers (for textual data)
are now int org.jetel.data.parser. All data formatters (for textual data) are in
org.jetel.data.formatter. Also lookups have been moved to separate package -
org.jetel.data.lookup.
+ Extended interface definition RecordTransform to support variety of transformation
components. Use DataRecordTransform (in org.jetel.component package) class as a base
class for your custom transformations.
It allows you to omit implementation of many methods from RecordTransform interface
which are not used/called most of the time but have to be provided.
+ created new package org.jetel.data.lookup - base for consolidating
lookup tables support (old lookup tables have been put there). New
interface LookupTable has been created.
+ updated compareTo() methods for all data objects (NumericDataField,
StringDataField, etc.) to support comparison with various object types.
+ FixLenDataParser2 has been updated to support line separators (when fix-len
record is delimited by new-line character(s))
+ components FixLenDataReaderNIO,FixLenDataWriterNIO have been enhanced
to allow specifying of which character(s) is used to separate
record on line - if required.


REL 1-1-0
---------
New features:
+ change of lincese from GPL to LGPL
+ enhanced DBOutputTable to allow for hand-written SQL/DML statements - this
should give 100% flexibility when populating target DB table
+ improved CopySQL primitives to cope with basic datatype conversions - integer->decimal,
date->datetime, etc. - it regards to Clover-DB interaction
+ graph layouts (component attributes) can now reference globally defined
properties (through ${...property name...} ). These references are resolved
when materializing componets/metadata.
+ added handling of NULLs when copying data to/from Database 
for fields (String, Date, Integer, Numeric);
+ for components requiring transformation classes to be specified (e.g. Reformat,Joins..),
the possibility to embed the Java source into XML text defining graph layout is possible. The source
code gets automatically compiled. When the graph is executed multiple times, it is
checked whether the source code changed and if not, compilation is skipped.

Bugs corrected:
+ fixed bug in CopyDate class (CopySQLData) when copying/setting DATE filed - thanks to Khelfa Mohamed


REL 1-0-8
---------
New features:
+ updated DBOutputTable component to support selective source2target fields
mapping - attribute cloverFields added.
+ updated DBOutputTable to support batch updates
+ updated Sort component to support lexicographics sorting & normal sorting
+ created new component - HashJoin.
+ created new class HashKey (used for building hash tables of DataRecords)
+ created new class RecordComparator to be used for sorting DataRecords
+ added Java Properties for DataRecordMetadata and DataFieldMetadata
+ new component CheckForeignKey added - contributed by Stewart Jeacocke
+ altered Filter component to send rejected records to second output port
  (if connected)

Bugs corrected:
+ fixed problem in DataRecordMetadataXMLReaderWriter - part writing XML was wrongly
outputting format string for defaultValue attribute.
