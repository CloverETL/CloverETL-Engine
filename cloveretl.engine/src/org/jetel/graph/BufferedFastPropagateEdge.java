/**
 * This edge implementation ensures that written data records are immediately available for reading thread (fast-propagate)
 * and ensures that writing operation never blocks the writing thread - internal unlimited cache is used.
 * 
 * Two in-memory records queue (CircularBufferQueue) are used. If reading thread is faster than writing thread, only
 * one queue is used for reading and writing at once. But if writing thread is getting faster than reading thread,
 * the shared records queue gets full. The second records queue is used for writing from now. Now if even the second queue is
 * full and the reading thread is still processing data records from the first queue, content of the second queue is saved
 * to unlimited persistent buffer queue (PersistentBufferQueue). From now both threads use different in-memory queues. Reading
 * thread reads data from a reading queue and writing thread writes data to a writing queue. If reading queue is empty, queue is
 * refilled from persistent buffer queue (from temporary file). If no data are available in persistent buffer queue, reading thread
 * starts to share in-memory records queue with writing thread.
