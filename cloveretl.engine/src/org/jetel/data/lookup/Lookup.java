/**
 * This interface serves as a provider to lookup table data. Whenever user wants to access to lookup table data
 * associated with a key, he has to create this 'proxy' object via createLookup() method invoked on a lookup table.
 * Initialization of lookup is performed during the first calling of {@link #seek()} or {@link #seek(DataRecord)} method. 
 * Then the given instance provides all appropriate records through the Iterator<DataRecord> interface.
 * The owner of this object can whenever change query to the lookup table and consequently call seek() method
 * to restart iterator on a different location of lookup table data.
