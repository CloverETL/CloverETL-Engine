#MAX_RECORD_SIZE - this limits the maximum size of data record in binary form. The binary form is the form used by Clover 
#when manipulating data.
#Parser are here to convert text representation or database representation of data records to Clover's internal. 
#Some data can have larger representation in text form - dates, numbers and some shorter - strings, for example 
#(java stores strings in unicode - 16bits per character).
#If you start getting buffer overflow or similar errors, increase this value. The limit is theoretically 2^31 , 
#but you should keep it under 64K.

#memory utilization.

#It determines what is the maximum size of one particular data field in text format.

#The impact on memory utilization is low as each parser your graph uses allocates only one such buffer.

#Again, increasing this value does not have big impact on overall memory utilization as only

#It has been tested that the performance improvement is negligible. 
#However, if you increase the size of MAX_RECORD_SIZE , make sure this value is minimally 2*MAX_RECORD_SIZE.
