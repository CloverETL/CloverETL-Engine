/**
 * This exception allows to wrap an existing error message and stacktrace in string form.
 * This exception is useful wherever you need to throw an exception but the cause exception
 * is available only in string form. For example RunRecord of a failing graph provides
 * only two strings - errMessage and errException.
 * The <code>causeStackTrace</code> passed into constructor is now taken into consideration only in
 * {@link ExceptionUtils#stackTraceToString(Throwable)}.
