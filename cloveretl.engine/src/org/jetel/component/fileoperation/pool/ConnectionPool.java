/**
 * An implementation of a generic connection pool, a thread-safe singleton.
 * 
 * A connection is identified with an {@link Authority}.
 * When the pool associated with a given authority is empty,
 * an new connection is created and returned.
 * 
 * Connections are tested to be functional before they are returned
 * in {@link #borrowObject(Authority)}.
 * 
 * {@link GenericKeyedObjectPool} ensures that the pools for individual
 * authorities are destroyed when there are no more active or idle objects
 * for a given key.
