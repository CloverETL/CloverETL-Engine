 * Components can provide default metadata for theirs input and output ports.
 * These metadata are automatically propagated to connected edges if the edge does not have
 * defined metadata. Propagation resolver is available to recursive
 * metadata searching. For example if you want to say, that metadata 
 * on requested port are identical with the metadata on an other port -
 * use {@link MetadataPropagationResolver} to find the metadata.
